# Meetup Door Prize

## About

> Do you run a group on `Meetup.com` and give out door prizes?

> Or maybe you give out raffle tickets, throw darts at the attendance sheet, or arm wrestle for the door prizes?

> Don't you wish there was a better way?

**There is!**  With this open-source project you just enter in the URL of your Meetup event and simply press some buttons!

# Try it out at <a href="http://www.meetupdoorprize.com" target="_blank"><code>meetupdoorprize.com</code></a>
