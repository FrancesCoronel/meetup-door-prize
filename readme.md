#Meetup Door Prize

##What it's for
Do you run a group on Meetup.com and give out door prizes?  Do you give out raffle tickets, throw darts at the attendance sheet, or arm wrestle for the door prizes?
Don't you wish there was a better way?

There is!  With this open-source project you just enter in the URL of your meetup event and press some buttons!

##How to set it up
First, you'll need a Meetup.com API key.  They're free.
Next, create a private.keys.js file in the scripts directory.

Inset the line: var apiKey = "your_api_key_here";

##How to choose a winner
In the textbox for the event url, enter the direct URL of your event and press the 'Find' button.
If the event was found, it will be listed below the URL box.
Now press the 'Choose Winner' button to select a random winner.

##Man, that's ugly!
Yeah, this is a work in progress.  You have some deisgn skills?  Put them to work and I'll give you credit.
